This is a multi-threaded CPU miner for Bitcoin on Intel Xeon Phi,
fork of Pooler's cpuminer, which was initially
a fork from Jeff Garzik's reference cpuminer.

License: GPLv2.  See COPYING for details.

Git tree:   https://github.com/kiyominer/cpuminer

Dependencies:
	libcurl			http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/ (built for mic)
	jansson			http://www.digip.org/jansson/
		(jansson is included in-tree)

Basic Linux build instructions:
	./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
	./configure --host=x86_64-k1om-linux CC=icc CFLAGS="-O2 -mmic" LDFLAGS="-O2 -mmic"
	make

Architecture-specific notes:
	mmic:	The miner can take advantage of KNCI instructions.

Usage instructions:  Run "minerd --help" to see options.

Connecting through a proxy:  Use the --proxy option.
To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host.
Protocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also
available since libcurl 7.18.0.
If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy
and all_proxy environment variables.

Also many issues and FAQs are covered in the forum thread
dedicated to this program,
